title: We sent our first commands to the 3DS!
---

Huge news!

After quite a bit of trial and error with the wires inside the 3DS, we are finally able to send an input to it!

So far, I only soldered in wires for the D-Pad and the XABY buttons, for testing.

Now that we have a working arduino sketch that is able to read inputs from a gamecube controller and send them to the 3DS, we are almost there!

Words can't express how happy I'm feeling with this right now.

## Next Steps

Now that we got to this point, here are the next milestones I'll try reaching:

- Wiring all inputs
- Wiring a Bluetooth Receiver! That's right, I just changed the whole project! Now we will also support bluetooth controllers. Wish me luck.
- Figure out the strategy for working with the plethora of buttons of the new 3DS (WE NEED MORE PINS!)
- Make some automated bots/programmable macros and stuff. This will be awesome.

Let's fucking go!

Here is quick video of the first input ever sent to my 3DS from an external controller:
