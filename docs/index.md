# 3ds-controller

Connect an external controller to a 3DS device!

This is something I have been wanting to have on my 3DS for years.

Since Loopy seems to be out of the market for good, let's make it ourselves!

This is a WIP. And I will be documenting my progress over at the [Dev Blog](dev-blog.md)
